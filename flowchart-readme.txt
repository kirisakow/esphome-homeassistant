If the 1st if condition is met, the 2nd if condition is queried.

If the 1st if condition is not met, the 1st condition is queried again.

If the 2nd if condition is met, the output is switched ON and the ON timer begins to run.

If the 2nd if condition is not met, the query for the 1st if condition begins again.

After the output has been switched ON and the ON timer has expired, the 3rd if condition is queried. If this is fulfilled, the output switches off and the off timer begins to run.
After the OFF timer has expired, the first if query begins again.

If the 3rd if condition is not met, the query of the 3rd if condition begins again

In the case of NO, I don't know whether a time delay needs to be installed in the 1st, 2nd or 3rd if condition so that the condition is not queried continuously

Maybe this will help create the conditions?

Thank you very much Josef
